  <h1>Zombie Cowpocalypse: The game of strategy {Story}</h1>
  <p>
      In this game, there will be a zombie apocalypse. Within the apocalypse, the zombies are much smarter and think a lot more strategically. It's your choice in which path you take. Will you take the right one? Or will you die along with your cow buddy?
      It was night time and you heard noises. At first you didn't mind it because you thought it was just the wind. After a little while, you started hearing growling and groans. It sounded a lot like zombies.
